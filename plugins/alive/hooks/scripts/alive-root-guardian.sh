REASON="Cannot write '${FILE_NAME}' to the world root. Nothing lives at root except the 5 domain folders (01_Archive through 05_Experiments) and hidden files. Route this to the right place: if it belongs to a walnut, put it in that walnut's _kernel/ or as a deliverable in the walnut root. If it's an input, put it in 03_Inbox/. If it's a new project, create a walnut with alive:create-walnut. Ask the human where it should go."
