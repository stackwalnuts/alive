# Extend

Build custom capabilities that integrate cleanly with the ALIVE Context System.

Not about adjusting preferences or voice (that's `alive:settings`). Extend is about creating NEW things — skills, rules, hooks — that make the system do something it couldn't before.

---

## What It Builds

| Type | What it is | Where it lives |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Skill** | Repeatable workflow with instructions | `.alive/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |
| **Rule** | Behavioral constraint or guide | `.alive/rules/{rule-name}.md` |
| **Hook** | Automated trigger on system events | `.alive/hooks/` (scripts + hooks.json) |
| **Plugin** | Distributable package of skills + rules + hooks | Hands off to `contributor@alivecontext` |

---

## Flow

### 1. Understand What the Human Wants

"I want to automatically tag emails by walnut"
"Every time I save, it should update my project board"
"I keep doing this manually every session — can we automate it?"

The squirrel determines: is this a skill (process), a rule (constraint), a hook (automation), or a combination?

```
╭─ squirrel that sounds like a hook — an automated trigger that fires on save.
│  Want me to build it?
│
│  It would:
│  - Fire after every alive:save
│  - Read the routed stash items
│  - Update your project board via API
│
│  > Build it / Tell me more / Not now
╰─
```

### 2. Check Compatibility

Before writing anything:
- Read the current plugin version from `plugin.json`
- Check which hook events are available (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PreCompact, UserPromptSubmit)
- Verify the name doesn't collide with existing skills, rules, or hooks
- Check for rule contradictions with existing rules

### 3. Write to the Human's Space

**NEVER write to the plugin cache.** Plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/`) gets overwritten on update. Custom capabilities live in the human's own space:

- Custom skills: `.alive/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- Custom rules: `.alive/rules/{rule-name}.md`
- Custom hooks: `.alive/hooks/` (scripts + `.claude/hooks.json` additions)

These persist across plugin updates. They're the human's own.

### 3.5. Symlink for Discovery

Claude Code only discovers skills in `~/.claude/skills/`. After writing a custom skill to `.alive/skills/`, **always create the symlink**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/{skill-name}
ln -sf "$WORLD_ROOT/.alive/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md" "$HOME/.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md"
```

The session-new hook auto-syncs these on every startup, but creating the symlink immediately means the skill is available in the current session without restart.

**This is mandatory.** A skill without its symlink is invisible to Claude Code.

### 4. Validate

After writing:
- Test the skill/rule/hook runs without errors
- Verify it doesn't conflict with existing system behavior
- Confirm it loads on next session start

### 5. Confirm

```
╭─ squirrel built: auto-tag-emails
│
│  Type: hook (PostToolUse)
│  Location: .alive/hooks/auto-tag-emails.sh
│  Fires: after every email capture via alive:capture-context
│  Does: reads email sender, matches against person walnuts, tags accordingly
│
│  Test it now?
╰─
```

---

## Proactive Trigger

The squirrel watches for repeated patterns across sessions. When it spots the human doing the same thing manually:

```
╭─ squirrel spotted
│  You've done this 3 sessions in a row. Should this be a skill?
│
│  > Make it a skill?
│  1. Yeah, let's build it
│  2. Not yet
│  3. What would it look like?
╰─
```

Pattern detection looks for:
- Same sequence of tool calls across sessions
- Similar stash items routing the same way repeatedly
- Manual file operations that could be automated
- Repeated phrases like "I always do X before Y"

---

## Custom Skill Structure

A custom skill follows the same format as core skills:

```
.alive/skills/{skill-name}/
  SKILL.md          # Instructions (same format as plugin skills)
  heavy-revive.md   # Optional sub-docs loaded on demand
  templates/        # Optional templates used by the skill
```

The SKILL.md frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: {skill-name}
description: "What this skill does — one sentence"
user-invocable: true
---
```

### Custom Rule Structure

```markdown
---
type: rule
name: {rule-name}
version: 1.0
scope: world | walnut:{name} | session
---

# {Rule Name}

[What this rule constrains or guides, when it applies, what behavior it enforces]
```

### Custom Hook Structure

Hook scripts in `.alive/hooks/` with corresponding entries in `.claude/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "PostToolUse",
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "command": ".alive/hooks/my-custom-hook.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Marketplace Awareness

When a custom skill is polished and battle-tested:

```
╭─ squirrel this skill could work for other builders
│  Want to package it for the marketplace?
│
│  > Next step?
│  1. Package for marketplace (needs contributor plugin)
│  2. Keep it personal
│  3. Tell me more about the marketplace
╰─
```

**Contributor plugin handoff:** For marketplace packaging, PII stripping, testing, and publishing -> suggest installing `contributor@alivecontext`. This is a SEPARATE plugin, not part of the alive core. The extend skill's job ends at building working custom capabilities. The contributor plugin handles everything from packaging to publishing.

```
╭─ squirrel to publish this skill:
│
│  1. Install the contributor plugin:
│     claude plugin install contributor@alivecontext
│
│  2. Run: alive:contribute {skill-name}
│     It handles: PII check, packaging, testing, submission
│
│  > Install contributor plugin now?
╰─
```

## What Extend Is NOT

- Not `alive:settings` — tune adjusts preferences and config. Extend creates new capabilities.
- Not a code editor — extend builds Alive-native skills/rules/hooks. For general coding, just code.
- Not the marketplace — extend builds. The contributor plugin publishes.

Tune adjusts the dials. Extend adds new dials.
