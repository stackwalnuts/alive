# run-inspector-snapshot.sh — generate a normalized MCP contract snapshot.
#
# Drives the MCP Inspector CLI against the alive-mcp server running over
# the frozen fixture world (``tests/fixtures/world-basic``) and writes a
# deterministic JSON snapshot to stdout.
#
# Supported methods (positional arg, default ``tools/list``):
#   tools/list      — 10 frozen v0.1 tools
#   resources/list  — 4 kernel resources × walnut_count (12 for fixture)
#   prompts/list    — stub for v0.2 (empty list)
#
# Determinism strategy
# --------------------
# The Inspector returns JSON that is STABLE in content but NOT in key
# order. We canonicalize through the companion helper
# ``scripts/normalize_snapshot.py``, which (a) sorts every dict key
# recursively via ``json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)``, (b) sorts each
# list's elements by the natural identity key for that primitive
# (``name`` for tools, ``uri`` for resources, ``name`` for prompts),
# and (c) breaks ties with the item's canonical JSON so duplicate or
# missing identity keys cannot reintroduce non-determinism. Output is
# indented 2 spaces with a trailing newline so the golden fixture is a
# stable, diff-friendly text artifact.
#
# World hermeticity
# -----------------
# The Inspector must always snapshot the COMMITTED fixture World, not
# whatever ``ALIVE_WORLD_ROOT`` happens to be set to in the caller's
# shell. We therefore IGNORE ambient ``ALIVE_WORLD_ROOT`` /
# ``ALIVE_WORLD_PATH`` by default and read only the dedicated
# ``ALIVE_CONTRACT_WORLD_ROOT`` override (used by tests that stand up
# a custom fixture). This prevents a developer with a real World
# pointer from silently rewriting goldens against their personal
# data — a subtle footgun the first review round flagged.
#
# T14 → T15 transition (dependency pinning)
# ----------------------------------------
# T14 pins the Inspector version INLINE via the
# ``INSPECTOR_VERSION`` constant below — ``npx -y
# @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@<INSPECTOR_VERSION>`` — so an upstream
# Inspector release cannot spontaneously break the snapshot diff. The
# cost of inline pinning is that the first run on a cold machine still
# touches the npm registry to fetch that version into the npx cache;
# that is acceptable for LOCAL dev.
#
# For CI, T15 replaces this dynamic-fetch path with a committed
# ``package-lock.json`` + ``npm ci`` install phase and swaps the
# invocation to ``./node_modules/.bin/mcp-inspector`` — the
# no-phone-home posture in T15 forbids any network access during the
# test phase. To bump Inspector: update ``INSPECTOR_VERSION`` here,
# update T15's ``package-lock.json`` to match, then
# ``scripts/update-snapshots.sh`` to regenerate the goldens.
#
# Exit codes
# ----------
#   0  success, snapshot written to stdout
#   1  invalid arguments or missing toolchain (node/npx/uv)
#   2  Inspector returned non-JSON on stdout (server print contamination)
#   3  Inspector subprocess failed (non-zero exit)

Environment:
  ALIVE_CONTRACT_WORLD_ROOT   optional; overrides which world the

                              the default is the committed fixture
                              world under tests/fixtures/world-basic,
                              which is what the committed goldens were
                              produced against. Overriding this WILL
                              produce a different snapshot and should
                              only be done when testing a synthetic
                              fixture for a new contract case.
