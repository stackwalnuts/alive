"""MCP Inspector CLI contract tests (fn-10-60k.14 / T14).

Protects against silent contract drift — the kind of change that DOES
NOT throw an error but quietly alters LLM behavior. Per the
"Your MCP Server's Tool Descriptions Changed Last Night Nobody Noticed"
anti-pattern flagged in the research bundle: a one-word tweak to a
tool's ``description`` or a loosened ``inputSchema`` can silently change
downstream agent behavior. The only way to catch it is a snapshot
diff, run in CI on every build.

Strategy
--------
For each frozen MCP list method (``tools/list``, ``resources/list``,
``prompts/list``):

1. Invoke ``scripts/run-inspector-snapshot.sh`` with the fixture world.
   The shell wrapper handles npx/uv orchestration; we just capture its
   stdout.
2. Compare the stdout against the committed golden at
   ``tests/fixtures/contracts/<method>.snapshot.json``.
3. On mismatch, print a unified diff and a one-line instruction telling
   the developer how to intentionally update the golden if the change
   is desired.

Why the generator is the test's source of truth
-----------------------------------------------
The committed golden was produced by running the SAME generator against
the SAME fixture. So any diff under a clean repo means the Inspector's
current output diverged from the snapshot, not that the normalization
logic itself changed. If normalization DOES change (``normalize_snapshot``
evolves), re-running ``scripts/update-snapshots.sh`` re-canonicalizes
all three fixtures in lockstep.

Skip posture
------------
Local dev: if ``npx`` / ``node`` / ``uv`` are missing from PATH the
test SKIPS with a clear reason rather than failing mysteriously. This
keeps unit-test runs clean for contributors on Python-only machines.

CI: when the environment variable ``CI`` is truthy (GitHub Actions and
most CI runners set ``CI=true`` automatically), a missing toolchain is
a HARD FAILURE. The T15 CI job must provide all three binaries so the
"CI diffs on every run" invariant cannot be silently bypassed by a
pipeline that forgot to install Node.

T15 hand-off
------------
T15 pins the Inspector via a committed ``package-lock.json`` and
switches the generator from ``npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector``
to ``./node_modules/.bin/mcp-inspector``. THIS test file and the
golden fixtures do not change — only the shell wrapper swaps its
invocation target.
